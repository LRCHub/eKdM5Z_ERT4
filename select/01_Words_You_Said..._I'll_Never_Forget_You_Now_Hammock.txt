The words you said,
I'll never forget them now...
You wished yourself dead,
I'll never forget you now...
You shivered and you bled,
You never figured it out...

I just want,
To hear you again...
I so long,
To feel you again...
I know now,
I'll never see you again...
I know now,
I'll never see you again...
