[00:00.97] I used to be so happy
[00:01.95] But without you here I feel so low
[00:06.68] I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
[00:12.44] 'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
[00:15.92] It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
[00:19.92] It's buried deep inside me but I
[00:21.38] Feel there's something you should know
[00:40.38] 
[00:26.47] I will never forget you
[00:28.24] You'll always be by my side
[00:32.67] From the day that I met you
[00:35.35] I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
[00:38.74] And I will never want much more
[00:42.00] And in my heart I will always be sure
[00:45.36] I will never forget you
[00:49.01] And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die
[01:15.01] 
[00:58.97] 'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)
[01:12.03] 'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)
[01:31.53] 
[01:19.58] Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
[01:26.01] I wonder what would happen
[01:28.24] If we went back and put up a fight
[01:31.62] 'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
[01:34.51] It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
[01:38.36] So what in this world do you think could
[01:41.76] Ever take you off my mind (take you off my mind)
[02:05.76] 
[01:45.65] I will never forget you
[01:48.71] And you'll always be by my side
[01:52.37] From the day that I met you
[01:55.22] I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
[01:57.89] And I will never want much more
[02:00.63] And in my heart I will always be sure
[02:03.82] I will never forget you
[02:07.47] And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die
[02:32.47] 
[02:11.99] Feeling it, loving it
[02:13.10] Everything that we do
[02:14.12] And all along, I knew I had something special with you
[02:18.62] But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
[02:21.32] But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you
[02:50.82] 
[02:25.10] Feeling it, loving it
[02:26.19] Everything that we do
[02:27.86] And all along, I knew I had something special with you
[02:30.56] But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
[02:34.54] I can't hide my connection with you
[02:52.04] 
[02:38.81] I will never forget you
[02:40.97] And you'll always be by my side
[02:44.01] From the day that I met you
[02:46.62] I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
[02:50.54] And I will never want much more
[02:53.74] And in my heart I will always be sure
[02:56.51] That I will never forget you
[02:59.65] And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die
[03:24.65] 
[03:04.48] 'Til the day I die
[03:06.73] 'Til the day I die
[03:07.96] 'Til the day I die
[03:09.55] 'Til the day I die
[03:12.99] 'Til the day I die
[03:14.62] 'Til the day I die
[03:23.62] 
[03:16.46] You will always be by my side
[03:18.07] I will never forget you
[03:19.55] I will never, never, never, never, never, never
[03:25.56] I will never forget you
[03:29.60] 'Til the day I die
