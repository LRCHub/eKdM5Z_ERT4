[00:36.26] Told you everything I knew about me
[00:38.71] Didn't listen to a word I say
[00:40.68] Spill my guts, you just threw them away
[01:00.18] 
[00:44.67] Never cared about me
[00:46.39] Only wanted to be your friend
[00:48.31] Now I know that it's gotta end
[01:03.31] 
[00:52.10] Never cared a thing about me
[00:56.12] And now, I will, I will
[01:07.62] 
[00:59.89] I will never forget you
[01:04.66] I will never forgive you
