It's always second nature
for me to put you first
I would call you later
if I could find the words
I know that I should
hate you
'cause you're
easier to blame
But I won't look back
on our love like that
No, I can't pretend
I don't know your body
like the back of my hand
Nobody can hold me in the
way that you can
Even when you go,
I'll never forget you
Baby, for tonight
Can we just forget and push
our problems aside?
I still hold your name to
every tear I cried
But I hope that you know
I'll never regret you,
never regret you
I hope that you know I'll
never regret you,
never regret you
Know we got our issues,
darlin', everybody does
I'll say that I don't miss you
if a lie is what you want
I kept every photo
and I hold 'em like a grudge
'Cause I still look back
on our love like that
No, I can't pretend
(Can't pretend)
I don't know your body
like the back of my hand
Nobody can hold me in the
way that you can
Even when you go,
I'll never forget you
(Never forget you)
Baby, for tonight
(For tonight)
Can we just forget and push
our problems aside?
I still hold your name to
every tear I cried
But I hope that you know
I'll never regret you,
never regret you
Ooh, never regret you,
never regret you
I hope that you know I'll
never regret you,
never regret you
Baby, for tonight
(For tonight)
Can we just forget and push
our problems aside?
I still hold your name to
every tear I cried
But I hope that you know
I'll never regret you,
never regret you
